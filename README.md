# Temperature Scales Converter and Status

This is an ongoing project for converting temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin scales, and providing status messages based on specific temperature points.

## Project Status

This project is currently under development. The core functionalities for temperature conversion and status reporting are being implemented and tested.

## Features (Under Development)

* **Temperature Conversion:**
    * Celsius to Kelvin
    * Kelvin to Celsius
    * Celsius to Fahrenheit
    * Fahrenheit to Celsius
    * Kelvin to Fahrenheit
    * Fahrenheit to Kelvin
* **Temperature Status Reporting:**
    * Provides status messages for Kelvin temperatures, indicating proximity to boiling or freezing points of water, or exact points.
    * Provides status messages for Fahrenheit temperatures, indicating proximity to boiling or freezing points of water, or exact points.
    * Provides status messages for Celsius temperatures, indicating proximity to boiling or freezing points of water, or exact points.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you need to have Go installed.

### Running the Example

You can run the `main.go` file to see a basic example of the conversion and status functionality:

```bash
go run main.go
